# Changelog

All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

The format is based on [Keep a Changelog](https://keepachangelog.com/en/1.0.0/).

## [Unreleased]

### Added

- `retentionMaxSizeMB` config option (size-based retention, independent
  of the existing `retentionDays`).

### Decided

- Standalone — no dependency on `signalk-icom-m510e-plugin`.
- Retention configurable by age and/or total log size, whichever limit
  hits first prunes oldest-first.

## [0.1.0] - 2026-07-20

### Added

- Initial plugin scaffold: SignalK plugin metadata, config schema
  (`ipOverride`, `retentionDays`), and placeholder REST endpoints
  (`GET /status`, `GET /transmissions`).
- Placeholder webapp page.
- CI via SignalK's reusable `plugin-ci.yml` workflow.
- `node --test` smoke tests covering plugin metadata, lifecycle, and
  the placeholder routes.
- README documenting the phased project plan (Phase 0 research spike
  through Phase 4 retention/polish).

Radio-joining logic (discovery, sign-in, transmission capture) is not
implemented yet — see README.md.
